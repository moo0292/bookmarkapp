zlist

A little experiment - a hierarchical list storage and retrieval program,
which uses the filesystem as its database.
This is intended mainly for bookmarks, and for lightweight notes,
although it may work well for other things.

The beauty of this system will be that it is possible to
to express links, their descriptions, sections, and general
notes with only one type of data object.

The structure is very simple, everything in zlist is an item,
each item made of up to four parts:

 *  GUID (required)
 *  Mod time (required)
 *  Hyperlink
 *  Title
 *  Description


Storage

All we need for this approach is two directories storing JSON files:

    nodes/
    tree/

Nodes are individual objects or items, stored in a file
with the GUID as the name, followed by a checksum, which functionally
can be considered its version number.

The tree folder is the entire structure of the of the tree of data.


Access

We will access this through an Angular.js frontend, which will get
the data itself through a thin API.
